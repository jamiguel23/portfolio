      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Matt Miguel, and I am a software developer with experience in Customer Service and Home Pricing based in Seattle, WA. My job and life experience has taught me to never underestimate the ability of a team working together to achieve the same goal. Thatâ€™s what brought me to programming, the collaborative work involved to develop a meaningful product. I studied hospitality and have held customer facing roles for most of my career. I made the shift to home pricing, working closely with data analytics and machine learning, in early 2020 to better flex my skills as an analytical person. I was most recently a Pricing Analyst in the acquisitions team for Zillow Group but have made the transition to Code Fellows fulltime.  During my spare time I like to snowboard, cook meals for others, as well as spend time with my wife and 2 dogs. My goal is to become a full stack developer with a tight knit team where I can use my customer centric aptitudes to help better their online experience and general accessibly.",
